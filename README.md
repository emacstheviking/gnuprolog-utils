# GNU Prolog Utilities (personal)

Everybody grows their own collection of stuff over time, this is mine
for GNU Prolog.

Each predicate is documented but they are split into two files:

## utilities.pl

General utilities for day-to-day predicate battering.


## dcg_utilities.pl

Sometimes when you write a set of DCG rules you think "hang on, I did
this once before" but can never remeber where. Well, from now on,
that's in this for.
